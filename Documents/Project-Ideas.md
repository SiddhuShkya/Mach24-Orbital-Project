## üí° Example Project Ideas

### üåæ Agriculture

Agriculture data is key to understanding **global water consumption** and **food production**.  
Google Earth Engine provides a variety of **agriculture-related datasets** that can be used for analysis, including:

- **[USDA NASS Cropland Data Layers](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/)**  
  High-resolution cropland data for the United States, useful for identifying crop types and distribution.

- **[Global Food Security-Support Analysis Data (GFSAD)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/gfsad30v001/)**  
  Global layers that include:
  - üåç **Cropland extent** ‚Äî identifying agricultural areas across the globe.  
  - üåæ **Crop dominance** ‚Äî information on which crop types dominate in different regions.  
  - üíß **Watering sources** ‚Äî whether crops are irrigated or rainfed.

These datasets are essential for applications like:
- Monitoring agricultural expansion.  
- Estimating water use and crop productivity.  
- Detecting changes in land use related to food security and climate change.

### üèî Terrain

**Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)** describe the shape of Earth‚Äôs terrain.  
The Google Earth Engine data catalog contains several global and regional DEM datasets that are useful for terrain analysis, hydrology modeling, and environmental studies.

Key datasets include:

- **[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_SRTMGL1_003)**  
  - Global coverage at **30-meter resolution**.  
  - Provides elevation data suitable for terrain visualization, watershed analysis, and slope calculations.

- **Regional DEMs**  
  - Higher-resolution elevation data for specific regions, offering more detailed topographic information.

- **[WWF HydroSHEDS](https://www.hydrosheds.org/)**  
  - A hydrology database derived from SRTM.  
  - Includes data on river networks, watershed boundaries, and flow accumulation patterns.

These datasets are essential for tasks such as:
- Topographic mapping  
- Hydrological modeling and flood risk assessment  
- Land use planning and infrastructure development  
- Environmental change monitoring

### üåç Climate

**Climate datasets** provide insights into both **long-term climate trends** and **historical interpolations** of surface variables.  
They are essential for understanding climate variability, projecting future scenarios, and supporting environmental decision-making.

The Google Earth Engine data catalog includes a wide range of climate-related datasets, such as:

- **[NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NOAA_NCEP_RE)**  
  - Historical reanalysis data of atmospheric variables.  
  - Combines observations and model outputs to provide a long-term, continuous climate record.

- **[NLDAS-2](https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas)** (North American Land Data Assimilation System)  
  - Gridded meteorological data focused on North America.  
  - Useful for land surface modeling, drought analysis, and water resource studies.

- **[GridMET](https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html)**  
  - High-resolution gridded meteorological dataset for the contiguous U.S.  
  - Includes daily data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, and more.

- **[University of Idaho MACAv2-METDATA](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/UCSB-CHG_CHIRPS_DAILY)**  
  - Provides **downscaled climate model outputs** suitable for climate impact assessments and adaptation studies.
