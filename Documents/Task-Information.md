# 🛰 Mach24 Orbitals – Technical Assessment Task (GIS & AI)

## 📌 Task Summary

You need to build a system that can:

- **Analyze GIS satellite image data** (freely available online), and  
- **Provide a BI (Business Intelligence) or GUI interface** that shows changes over time in **natural** (e.g., forests, rivers, glaciers) or **anthropological** (human-made — e.g., urban expansion, roads, agriculture) environments.

---

## 🧠 Your System Should Do

- **Ingest** publicly available satellite imagery (e.g., from NASA, USGS, or Sentinel Hub).  
- **Process/analyze** the images to detect environmental changes over time (e.g., vegetation loss, land use changes, deforestation, urban growth).  
- **Visualize** the results using a GUI or BI dashboard. Examples:
  - Highlight changes on a map.  
  - Show charts or summary statistics (e.g., % forest cover lost between 2015–2025).  
  - Allow users to select a region/time period and view results.

## 🧰 You’re Allowed To

You may use existing **open-source tools**, such as:

- [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)  
- [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/)  
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)  
- [QGIS](https://qgis.org/)  
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) or [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)

Additional notes:

- You may use **AI tools** (including ChatGPT 😄) for help.  
- You may work with peers or ask others for guidance.

## 📝 You Must

- **Document** your workflow and resources (e.g., datasets, libraries, methods used).  
- Be able to **explain your code** during the interview.  
- **Submit your project** as a GitHub repository by **October 10, 2025**.  
- Send the repo link to 📧 `officialdevkota@gmail.com`.
